## HR Insights Dashboard Project: Risk Analysis

This document outlines a comprehensive risk analysis for the HR Insights Dashboard project, categorized by risk type.  Each risk includes identification, probability/impact assessment, mitigation strategies, monitoring indicators, and ownership.  Probability is assessed on a scale of 1-5 (1=Low, 5=High), and Impact on a scale of 1-5 (1=Low, 5=High).  The Risk Score is the product of Probability and Impact.

**I. Technical Risks and Technology-Related Challenges:**
