## HR Insights Dashboard - Acceptance Criteria

This document outlines the acceptance criteria for the HR Insights Dashboard project, covering functional, non-functional, and security aspects.  Each criterion is expressed using the Given-When-Then format and includes measurable success metrics, test scenarios, dependencies, risk factors, and mitigation strategies.


**I. HR AI Agent Maturity Assessment Tab**

**User Story 1:** As an HR leader, I want to see a maturity assessment based on the company HR Score framework so I can identify areas for improvement.

| Criterion | Given | When | Then | Success Metric | Test Scenarios | Dependencies | Risk Factors | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Functional** | The user is logged in and navigates to the "HR AI Agent Maturity Assessment" tab. | The user views the assessment. | The assessment displays a score based on the company HR Score framework, broken down by key areas with clear explanations and recommendations for improvement.  | Score accurately reflects input data; explanations and recommendations are clear and actionable (evaluated by 3 HR experts). |  Test with various data sets (high, low, average maturity scores); Verify calculations and recommendations. | HR Score framework data is available and integrated. | Inaccurate data from HR Score framework; unclear recommendations. | Data validation checks; expert review of recommendations; unit testing of calculation logic. |
| **Data Quality** | The system receives valid data from the HR Score framework. | The system processes the data. | The assessment accurately reflects the input data and generates a valid score. |  <99% accuracy in score calculation; No data inconsistencies. | Data comparison with source system; data validation rules implemented and tested. |  HR Score framework API integration. | Data inconsistencies; inaccurate calculations. | Data cleansing and transformation procedures; automated data quality checks. |
| **UI/UX** | The user is on the "HR AI Agent Maturity Assessment" tab. | The user interacts with the assessment. | The assessment is easy to understand, visually appealing, and navigable.  | User satisfaction score (survey of 5 HR leaders) >= 4/5; Task completion time < 5 minutes. | Usability testing; A/B testing of different visualizations. | Design mockups approved. | Poor visualization; confusing navigation. |  Iterative design based on user feedback; clear visual hierarchy. |


**II. Top HR Trends for 2025 Tab**

**User Story 2:** As an HR leader, I want to see the top HR trends for 2025 so I can proactively adapt our strategies.

| Criterion | Given | When | Then | Success Metric | Test Scenarios | Dependencies | Risk Factors | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Functional** | The user is logged in and navigates to the "Top HR Trends for 2025" tab. | The user views the tab. | The tab displays a list of top HR trends for 2025, with concise descriptions and relevant resources (links to articles, reports). | All trends are accurate and relevant; links are functional (checked by 2 HR experts). | Verify accuracy of trends using external reputable sources; check all links. | Trend data source identified and validated. | Inaccurate or outdated information; broken links. | Regular updates of trend data; link validation checks. |
