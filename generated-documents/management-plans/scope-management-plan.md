## Scope Management Plan: HR Insights Dashboard Project

**1. Introduction**

This Scope Management Plan outlines the processes and procedures for defining, validating, controlling, and managing the scope of the "HR Insights Dashboard" project.  It aligns with the PMBOK Guide (7th Edition) and ensures that the project delivers the intended functionality and value within the agreed-upon constraints.

**2. Project Scope Statement**

The project scope includes the development and deployment of an HR Insights Dashboard providing a comprehensive view of key HR metrics and assessments.  This dashboard will consist of five core tabs:

* **HR AI Agent Maturity Assessment:**  Measures HR activity maturity against the company HR Score framework, identifying improvement areas.
* **Top HR Trends for 2025:**  Highlights key HR trends impacting strategic decision-making.
* **Succession Planning Dashboard:**  Visualizes leadership pipeline, bench strength, and succession readiness.
* **Employee Experience Dashboard:**  Displays employee experience, engagement trends, and key drivers.
* **Employee Value Proposition Assessment:**  Analyzes EVP performance, benchmarking against industry standards.

**Exclusions:**  Integration with external systems beyond existing HR data sources, custom report generation beyond standard dashboard capabilities, and ongoing maintenance post-deployment (except for critical bug fixes within the first 30 days).

**3. Defining, Validating, and Controlling the Project Scope**

* **Defining Scope:**  The project scope will be defined through collaborative workshops with stakeholders (HR leadership, data analysts, IT representatives) to refine the requirements for each dashboard tab.  Prototypes and mockups will be created and reviewed iteratively to ensure alignment.
* **Validating Scope:**  Formal sign-off on the Project Scope Statement will be obtained from key stakeholders after the completion of the workshops and prototype review. This sign-off will constitute formal scope validation.
* **Controlling Scope:**  A Change Control process (detailed in Section 6) will be implemented to manage any scope changes.  All change requests will be documented, assessed for impact on time, cost, and quality, and approved by the Change Control Board (CCB).  Regular scope monitoring will be conducted using earned value management (EVM) techniques to track progress against the approved scope baseline.


**4. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**

The WBS will be a hierarchical decomposition of the project scope, organized by deliverable.  A sample WBS is presented below:

1.0 HR Insights Dashboard
    1.1 HR AI Agent Maturity Assessment
        1.1.1 Requirements Gathering
        1.1.2 Design & Development
        1.1.3 Testing & QA
        1.1.4 Deployment
    1.2 Top HR Trends for 2025
        1.2.1 Research & Data Collection
        1.2.2 Content Creation
        1.2.3 Design & Integration
        1.2.4 Testing & QA
        1.2.5 Deployment
    1.3 Succession Planning Dashboard
        1.3.1 Data Integration & Transformation
        1.3.2 Dashboard Design & Development
        1.3.3 Testing & QA
        1.3.4 Deployment
    1.4 Employee Experience Dashboard
        1.4.1 Data Integration & Transformation
        1.4.2 Dashboard Design & Development
        1.4.3 Testing & QA
        1.4.4 Deployment
    1.5 Employee Value Proposition Assessment
        1.5.1 Data Analysis & Benchmarking
        1.5.2 Report Generation & Integration
        1.5.3 Testing & QA
        1.5.4 Deployment
    1.6 Project Management
    1.7  Overall Testing and QA across all dashboards
    1.8 Deployment and Go-Live


**5. WBS Dictionary**

The WBS Dictionary will be a document detailing each Work Package (lowest level of the WBS).  It will include:

* **Work Package ID:** Unique identifier for each work package.
* **Description:** Detailed description of the work to be performed.
* **Responsible Party:** Individual or team responsible for executing the work.
* **Start Date:** Planned start date.
* **End Date:** Planned completion date.
* **Duration:** Estimated duration of the work package.
* **Resources:**  Resources required (personnel, software, hardware).
* **Budget:** Estimated cost.
* **Dependencies:** Dependencies on other work packages.
* **Acceptance Criteria:** Criteria for completion and sign-off.

The WBS Dictionary will be maintained in a shared online document (e.g., Google Sheet, SharePoint) and approved by the project manager and key stakeholders before project commencement.  Updates will be managed through the Change Control process.

**6. Process for Controlling Scope Changes**

* **Change Request Submission:** All scope change requests must be submitted formally using a standardized Change Request Form. This form will detail the proposed change, rationale, impact assessment (time, cost, resources), and proposed solution.
* **Change Request Evaluation:** The CCB (composed of representatives from HR, IT, and project management) will review the change request and assess its impact.
* **Change Approval/Rejection:** The CCB will approve or reject the change request based on its impact and alignment with project objectives.  Approved changes will be documented and incorporated into the project scope baseline. Rejected change requests will be documented with the rationale for rejection.
* **Change Implementation:** Approved changes will be implemented following a defined process, including updates to the WBS, WBS Dictionary, schedule, and budget.
* **Change Verification:** After implementation, the change will be verified to ensure it meets the acceptance criteria.

**7. Formal Verification and Acceptance of Deliverables**

Each deliverable (each dashboard tab) will undergo a formal verification and acceptance process.  This will involve:

* **Testing:**  Thorough testing by the QA team to ensure functionality and compliance with requirements.
* **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**  Testing by representatives from the HR department to validate functionality and usability.
* **Sign-off:**  Formal sign-off by the relevant stakeholders indicating acceptance of the deliverable.

This process will be documented and tracked in the project tracking system.


This Scope Management Plan will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness.
