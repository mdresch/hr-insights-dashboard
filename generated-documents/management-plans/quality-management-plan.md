## Quality Management Plan: HR Insights Dashboard Project

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the Quality Management Plan for the HR Insights Dashboard project, aligning with PMBOK 7th Edition standards.  The plan details the processes, procedures, and metrics to ensure the project delivers a high-quality, user-friendly, and accurate HR insights dashboard meeting stakeholder expectations.

**2. Quality Objectives**

* **Accuracy:** Data presented on the dashboard must be accurate, reliable, and consistent with source data.  Error rate should be less than 0.5%.
* **Usability:** The dashboard must be intuitive, easy to navigate, and user-friendly for HR leaders with varying levels of technical expertise.  User satisfaction score (measured via post-implementation survey) should be at least 4 out of 5.
* **Completeness:** All planned functionalities (as defined in the project scope) must be delivered and fully operational.
* **Timeliness:** The project must be completed within the allocated timeframe.
* **Performance:** The dashboard should load quickly and respond efficiently to user interactions.  Average load time should be under 2 seconds.
* **Security:** The dashboard must adhere to all relevant security policies and regulations, protecting sensitive employee data.

**3. Quality Standards**

* **Data Accuracy:** Data validation and verification processes will be implemented at each stage of data integration and transformation.
* **Usability Standards:**  Nielsen Norman Group heuristics and ISO 9241-11 usability guidelines will be followed.
* **Security Standards:**  Compliance with company security policies and relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
* **Coding Standards:**  Adherence to established coding best practices and style guides for all programming languages used.

**4. Quality Metrics**

* **Defect Density:** Number of defects found per 1000 lines of code. Target: less than 2 defects/1000 lines.
* **User Satisfaction Score:**  Measured via post-implementation survey using a 5-point Likert scale. Target: 4 out of 5.
* **Data Accuracy Rate:** Percentage of accurate data points. Target: 99.5%
* **Average Load Time:** Measured in seconds. Target: under 2 seconds.
* **Test Coverage:** Percentage of code covered by unit and integration tests. Target: 90%.


**5. Quality Assurance Procedures and Activities**

* **Regular code reviews:** Conducted by peer developers to identify potential defects early.
* **Unit testing:**  Testing individual components of the dashboard.
* **Integration testing:** Testing the interaction between different components.
* **System testing:**  Testing the entire system as a whole.
* **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**  Real users will test the dashboard to ensure it meets their needs.
* **Security testing:** Penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.

**6. Quality Control Processes and Checkpoints**

* **Gate reviews:**  Formal reviews at the end of each development phase to assess quality and progress.
* **Defect tracking:**  Using a defect tracking system to monitor and manage identified defects.
* **Regular status meetings:**  To discuss quality issues and track progress.
* **Inspection checkpoints:**  Visual inspection of dashboards and reports for clarity and accuracy.

**7. Testing Strategies and Acceptance Criteria**

* **Test Strategy:**  A mix of automated and manual testing will be used.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  Defined in detail in the project scope document, including functional requirements, non-functional requirements (performance, security, usability), and data accuracy requirements.

**8. Quality Improvement Processes and Continuous Improvement**

* **Regular retrospectives:**  Team meetings to identify areas for improvement in the development process.
* **Lessons learned:**  Documenting lessons learned from each phase to prevent future issues.
* **Process improvement initiatives:** Implementing process improvements based on lessons learned and retrospective feedback.

**9. Quality Roles and Responsibilities**

* **Project Manager:** Overall responsibility for quality management.
* **Quality Assurance Lead:** Responsible for overseeing quality assurance activities.
* **Developers:** Responsible for writing high-quality code and performing unit testing.
* **Testers:** Responsible for performing various levels of testing.
* **Business Analyst:**  Responsible for ensuring the dashboard meets business requirements.

**10. Quality Tools and Techniques**

* **Defect tracking system (e.g., Jira)**
* **Test management tool (e.g., TestRail)**
* **Code review tools (e.g., GitHub, GitLab)**
* **Data validation tools**
* **Usability testing tools**
* **Statistical Process Control (SPC)**

**11. Quality Documentation and Reporting Requirements**

* **Quality Management Plan:** This document.
* **Test Plan:**  Details the testing strategy and approach.
* **Test Cases:**  Specific test scenarios to be executed.
* **Defect Reports:**  Reports on identified defects and their resolution.
* **Quality Metrics Reports:**  Regular reports on key quality metrics.
* **UAT Report:**  Summarizing the results of UAT.

**12. Quality Risk Management and Mitigation Strategies**

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|---|---|---|---|
| Data inaccuracy | Medium | High | Implement robust data validation and verification procedures. |
| Poor usability | High | Medium | Conduct thorough usability testing and incorporate user feedback. |
| Security vulnerabilities | Low | High | Conduct regular security testing and implement appropriate security measures. |
| Delays in development | Medium | High | Implement agile development methodology and closely monitor progress. |


**13. Customer Satisfaction and Stakeholder Quality Requirements**
