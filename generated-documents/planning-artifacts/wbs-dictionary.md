**Note:**  This is a partial example.  Each numbered section (e.g., 2.0, 3.0, etc.) would follow a similar detailed structure as section 2.1.  Specific details for each tab, including resources, cost estimates, and timelines, would need to be filled in based on the specific requirements of each tab's functionality.  The cost estimates provided are illustrative and should be replaced with actual project cost breakdowns.  Risks should also be expanded upon with mitigation strategies.
