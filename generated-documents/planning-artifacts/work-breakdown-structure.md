This WBS utilizes a hierarchical structure, three levels of decomposition, and a coding system for easy identification.  All work packages are estimated to be within the 8-80 hour range, are clearly defined, and can be assigned to individual team members. The total estimated effort sums to 100% of the project scope.  Remember that these are estimates and should be refined during project planning.
