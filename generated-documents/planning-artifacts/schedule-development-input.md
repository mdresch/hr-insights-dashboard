**3. Activity Duration Estimates with Confidence Levels:**  Durations are estimates and may vary based on resource availability and unforeseen issues. Confidence levels (High, Medium, Low) reflect the certainty of the estimate.

**4. Activity Resource Requirements and Assignments:**

| ID | Resource Type          | Resource Name(s) | Role              |
|---|-----------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Business Analyst       | John Doe           | Requirements Gathering |
| 2 | UI/UX Designer         | Jane Smith         | Design             |
| 3 | Database Developer     | David Lee          | Development        |
| 4-8| Data Scientists/Analysts| Multiple           | Data Analysis, Dashboard Development |

| 12| DevOps Engineer        | Michael Brown      | Deployment         |


**5. Activity Sequence and Logical Relationships:**

(Using Precedence Diagramming Method)

* 1-2: FS (Finish-Start) - UI/UX Design starts after Requirements Gathering finishes.
* 1-3: FS - Database Design starts after Requirements Gathering finishes.
* 2-4, 2-5, 2-6, 2-7, 2-8: FS - Dashboard development starts after UI/UX Design finishes.
* 3-4, 3-5, 3-6, 3-7, 3-8, 3-9: FS - Dashboard development and data integration depend on database design.
* 4-9, 5-9, 6-9, 7-9, 8-9: FS - Data Integration depends on individual dashboard development.
* 9-10: FS - Testing starts after data integration.
* 10-11: FS - UAT starts after testing.
* 11-12: FS - Deployment starts after UAT.
* 12-13: FS - Post-launch support follows deployment.


**6. Network Diagram Logic and Dependencies:** A network diagram (e.g., using Microsoft Project or similar software) would visually represent the above relationships.

**7. Milestone List with Target Dates:** (Dates are placeholders, requiring further planning)

* **Milestone 1:** Requirements Complete (Week 1)
* **Milestone 2:** UI/UX Design Approved (Week 2)
* **Milestone 3:** Database Design Complete (Week 4)
* **Milestone 4:** All Dashboards Developed (Week 10)
* **Milestone 5:** Data Integration Complete (Week 12)
* **Milestone 6:** System Testing Complete (Week 14)
* **Milestone 7:** UAT Sign-off (Week 15)
* **Milestone 8:** Go-Live (Week 16)


**8. Resource Calendars and Availability Constraints:**  Resource availability needs to be documented individually, accounting for vacations, other projects, and potential capacity constraints.

**9. Organizational Process Assets and Historical Data:**  Include any relevant templates, standards, or historical data from previous dashboard projects (e.g., average development time for similar features, defect rates).

**10. Enterprise Environmental Factors Affecting Scheduling:**  These may include organizational policies, regulatory compliance requirements, IT infrastructure limitations, and budget constraints.

**11. Assumptions and Constraints Documentation:**

* **Assumptions:**  Sufficient resources will be available throughout the project.  Third-party APIs will function as expected. Data will be readily available for dashboard population.
* **Constraints:**  Fixed project budget.  Fixed project deadline.  Limited access to certain data sources.


**12. Risk Factors Impacting Schedule Development:**

* **Risk 1:** Resource unavailability or delays.
* **Risk 2:** Unexpected technical challenges during development.
* **Risk 3:** Data quality issues.
* **Risk 4:** Changes in requirements during the project.


**13. Schedule Baseline Development Methodology:** Critical Path Method (CPM) will be used to identify the critical path and ensure timely project completion.  Earned Value Management (EVM) will be used for performance monitoring.

**14. Performance Measurement Criteria:**

* Schedule Variance (SV)
* Schedule Performance Index (SPI)
* Critical Path Monitoring
* Milestone Achievement


**15. Schedule Change Control Procedures:** A formal change control process will be followed, including submitting change requests, evaluating impact, approving/rejecting changes, and updating the schedule accordingly.  This will be documented in a separate Change Control Plan.


This comprehensive Schedule Development Input provides a solid foundation for creating a detailed project schedule.  Further refinement and iterative planning will be necessary throughout the project lifecycle.  The use of project management software is strongly recommended for managing and tracking the schedule effectively.
