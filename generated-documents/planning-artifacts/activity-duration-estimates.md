## HR Insights Dashboard: Activity Duration Estimates

This document outlines the activity duration estimates for the "HR Insights Dashboard" project, adhering to PMBOK 7th Edition standards and employing three-point estimation techniques.

**Assumptions & Constraints:**

* **Resource Availability:** A dedicated team of 3 developers, 1 UX designer, and 1 data analyst are available for the project duration.  Resource availability is assumed to be consistent unless otherwise noted.
* **Historical Data:**  Historical data from similar dashboard projects suggests an average completion time of 20% longer than initially estimated. This will be factored into our estimates.
* **Technology Stack:**  The project utilizes a familiar technology stack, minimizing potential delays related to learning curves.
* **Client Availability:**  We assume consistent availability of key stakeholders for reviews and approvals throughout the project.

**Total Project Duration (Expected):**  Approximately 88 days (excluding buffers) + 14 (buffers) = 102 days

**Risk Management:**  A detailed risk register should be created, outlining mitigation strategies for identified risks.  Regular monitoring and control will be essential to manage potential delays.

**Note:**  The PERT method provides an expected duration, but the actual duration is likely to follow a probability distribution.  The confidence levels reflect the likelihood of completing the activity within the estimated timeframe.  Buffer times are added to critical activities
