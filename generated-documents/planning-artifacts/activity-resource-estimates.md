**II. Resource Calendars & Availability Constraints:**

Resource calendars will be managed using a project management tool (e.g., MS Project, Jira) to track availability, holidays, and potential conflicts.  Assumptions: 40-hour work week.  Specific availability constraints will be documented separately.


**III. Resource Rates & Cost Implications:**

Resource rates are estimates and may vary based on experience, location, and vendor contracts.  Detailed cost breakdown will be included in the project budget.


**IV. Resource Optimization Strategies & Alternatives:**

* **Outsourcing:** Consider outsourcing certain tasks (e.g., UI/UX design, backend development) to specialized vendors to reduce internal workload and potentially lower costs.
* **Resource leveling:**  Optimize resource allocation across activities to avoid over-allocation and delays.
* **Cross-training:** Train team members on multiple skills to enhance flexibility and reduce reliance on specific individuals.


**V. Team Structure & Organizational Requirements:**

A project team will be formed, including a Project Manager, a dedicated development team, and representatives from the HR department.  Clear roles and responsibilities will be defined in a RACI matrix.


**VI. Training & Skill Development Needs:**

Training needs will be identified based on team members' skill gaps.  Training might include workshops on specific technologies, agile methodologies, or data analysis techniques.


**VII. Vendor & Contractor Requirements:**

Vendor selection will follow a formal procurement process.  Contracts will specify deliverables, timelines, and payment terms.


**VIII. Resource Risk Factors & Mitigation Strategies:**

The table above includes some initial risk factors and mitigation strategies. A comprehensive risk register will be developed and regularly updated throughout the project.

**IX.  Assumptions:**

*  The project timeline is estimated; actual timelines may vary.
*  Resource rates are estimates and may need adjustments based on market conditions and vendor negotiations.
*  This document provides a high-level overview.  Detailed resource estimates will be developed as the project progresses.
