**Explanation:**

* **Activity-on-Node (AON):**  The diagram uses AON, where each box represents an activity.
* **Logical Relationships:**  FS (Finish-to-Start) is the default relationship (implied where not otherwise specified).  An example of a lag is shown between M and N.  An example of a resource constraint is noted between O and P.
* **Critical Path:** The critical path (H, R, S, T) is highlighted in a darker color.  Any delay on the critical path directly impacts the project completion date.
* **Lead/Lag Times:**  An example lag is shown between M and N.
* **Milestone Markers:** Project Start, Key Development Milestones (represented implicitly by the completion of each tab's development and testing), and Project Completion are effectively milestone markers.
* **Resource Constraints:** A note indicates a potential resource conflict between activities O and P.
* **External Dependencies:** The dependency on external data acquisition is shown with a link to activity X.
* **Risk Factors:** Potential risks are noted near relevant activities.
* **Alternative Paths:** A contingency path (U) is added to handle potential emergency bug fixes.

This enhanced diagram provides a more comprehensive view of the project schedule, incorporating key PMBOK 7th Edition aspects of schedule management. Remember to replace example lead/lag times, resource constraints, and risk factors with your project's specific details.  The Mermaid syntax might require adjustments depending on the rendering tool used.
